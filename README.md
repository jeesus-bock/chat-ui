# Chat UI

A simple proof-of-concept user interface built on solid-start. Used a learning and testing playground.

To be used in tandem with https://github.com/jeesus-bock/chat/ main branches should produce a working frontend/backend combination
at any given time. Dev branch is latest somewhat working stuff. in solid-start-beta I'm testing the waters with a more bleeding edge
version of solid-start and it's not working very well atm :)
